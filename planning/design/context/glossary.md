# Glossary of Terms

A reference glossary for outcomes-based financing terminology.

## Core Instruments

### Pay-for-Success (PFS)

An umbrella term for financing arrangements where payment is contingent on achieving predefined outcomes. The payer (usually government) only pays if results are verified. Also called **outcomes-based contracting** or **results-based financing**.

### Social Impact Bond (SIB)

The original and most common form of impact bond, first launched in the UK (Peterborough Prison, 2010). Despite the name "bond," SIBs are not traditional debt instruments—they are multi-party contracts where:
- Private investors provide upfront capital
- Service providers deliver interventions
- Government pays investors back (with return) only if outcomes are achieved

The "bond" terminology is somewhat misleading; these are closer to equity investments with outcome-contingent returns.

### Development Impact Bond (DIB)

A variant of the SIB model applied to international development contexts. Key differences:
- **Outcomes payers** are typically development agencies, foundations, or multilateral institutions rather than domestic governments
- Often operate in low- and middle-income countries
- May have different risk profiles and return expectations

Example: The Educate Girls DIB in Rajasthan, India (2015) was one of the first DIBs, funded by UBS Optimus Foundation with outcomes paid by the Children's Investment Fund Foundation.

### Impact Bond

A general term encompassing both SIBs and DIBs. Used when the specific domestic/development distinction is not relevant, or when referring to the instrument category broadly.

### Outcomes Fund

A pooled capital structure that pays for outcomes across multiple interventions, service providers, or geographies. Rather than structuring individual impact bond deals:
- Capital is aggregated into a fund
- The fund sets outcome prices (rate cards)
- Multiple providers can deliver services and claim payments for verified outcomes
- Reduces transaction costs compared to deal-by-deal structuring

**Key example**: The **Education Outcomes Fund (EOF)** aims to improve learning outcomes for 10 million children across Africa and the Middle East by paying for verified educational results.

### Rate Card

A standardized price list for outcomes used by outcomes funds. Specifies what the fund will pay for each verified outcome unit (e.g., "$X per child achieving grade-level literacy"). Allows multiple providers to deliver against the same outcome specifications.

## Stakeholder Terms

### Outcomes Payer

The party that pays for achieved outcomes. In SIBs, this is typically government. In DIBs, it may be a foundation, development agency, or multilateral institution. The outcomes payer only disburses funds after outcomes are independently verified.

### Impact Investor

An investor who provides upfront capital for social interventions, accepting both financial return and social impact as objectives. In impact bonds, investors bear the outcome risk—they may lose capital if outcomes are not achieved.

**Subtypes**:
- **Philanthropic investor**: Accepts below-market or zero returns; primary motivation is impact
- **Commercial impact investor**: Expects market-rate returns adjusted for risk
- **Blended finance investor**: Accepts concessionary returns to mobilize additional capital

### Service Provider / Delivery Organization

The organization that actually implements the intervention—delivers job training, provides early childhood education, runs recidivism prevention programs, etc. Often nonprofits with domain expertise. In impact bonds, service providers receive working capital from investors but don't bear outcome risk directly.

### Independent Evaluator

A third party responsible for measuring and verifying outcomes. Must be trusted by all deal parties. May use randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental methods, or administrative data analysis depending on the evaluation design.

### Intermediary

An organization that structures impact bond deals, coordinates between parties, and often provides ongoing management. Intermediaries reduce transaction costs by bringing specialized expertise.

**Examples**: Social Finance (UK, US, Israel), Third Sector Capital Partners, Maycomb Capital.

## Outcome Measurement Terms

### Outcome Metrics

The specific, measurable indicators that define success. Must be:
- **Measurable**: Can be objectively quantified
- **Attributable**: Can be linked to the intervention
- **Timely**: Observable within the contract period
- **Meaningful**: Actually represent the intended social value

Examples: recidivism rates, employment retention at 6 months, grade-level reading proficiency, stable housing duration.

### Counterfactual

What would have happened in the absence of the intervention. Establishing a credible counterfactual is essential for attributing outcomes to the intervention rather than external factors.

Methods for establishing counterfactual:
- **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)**: Gold standard but expensive and sometimes ethically complex
- **Quasi-experimental methods**: Difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, propensity score matching
- **Historical baseline**: Compare to prior cohorts (weakest method)

### Attribution

The challenge of demonstrating that observed outcomes were caused by the intervention rather than external factors. Central to impact bond disputes and a key focus of evaluator methodology.

### Additionality

Whether the intervention produced outcomes that would not have occurred otherwise. Related to counterfactual but emphasizes the incremental value added by the program.

## Financial Terms

### Upfront Capital

The initial investment provided by impact investors to fund the intervention before outcomes are achieved. This is the capital at risk.

### Outcome Payment

The payment made by the outcomes payer to investors upon verification of achieved outcomes. Typically structured as principal repayment plus return if successful; partial payment for partial success; no payment if outcomes not met.

### Success Payment / Performance Payment

Synonyms for outcome payment, emphasizing the contingent nature.

### Return Profile

The expected financial return to investors based on various outcome scenarios. May include:
- **Base case**: Expected return if outcomes meet targets
- **Upside case**: Return if outcomes exceed targets
- **Downside case**: Loss if outcomes fall short

### Risk-Adjusted Return

Return expectations accounting for the probability of outcome achievement. Impact bonds typically require higher nominal returns than traditional bonds because investors bear outcome risk.

### Blended Finance

An approach that uses catalytic capital (often concessionary or philanthropic) to mobilize additional private investment. In impact bonds, a foundation might accept first-loss position to attract commercial investors.

## Contract Structure Terms

### Outcomes Contract

The legal agreement specifying outcome metrics, payment terms, verification procedures, and risk allocation among parties.

### Payment Trigger

The threshold that must be met for outcome payments to be made. May be binary (all-or-nothing) or graduated (partial payments for partial success).

### Success Threshold

The minimum outcome level required for any payment to investors. Below this threshold, investors receive nothing.

### Cap and Floor

**Cap**: Maximum payment regardless of how much outcomes exceed targets.
**Floor**: Minimum payment (if any) regardless of underperformance. Most impact bonds have no floor—investors can lose entire principal.

### Clawback Provision

Contract terms allowing recovery of payments if outcomes are later found to be invalid or overstated.

## Related Mechanisms

### Outcomes-Based Commissioning

Government procurement that ties contractor payment to outcomes rather than outputs or activities. Broader than impact bonds—doesn't require private investment capital.

### Performance-Based Contract (PBC)

General term for contracts with payment tied to performance metrics. Impact bonds are a specific type of PBC with the additional element of external investment capital.

### Social Impact Incentives (SIINC)

A structure where outcome payments go to the enterprise delivering the intervention rather than to external investors. Rewards effective organizations directly without the intermediation of impact investors.

### Payment by Results (PbR)

UK government terminology for outcomes-based contracting. Broader than impact bonds—includes direct government contracts with providers where payment depends on results.

### Results-Based Financing (RBF)

Development sector terminology, particularly common in health financing. Encompasses various mechanisms where funding flows are tied to verified results.

## Program Design Terms

### Target Population

The specific group intended to receive the intervention and for whom outcomes are measured. Careful definition prevents "creaming" (selecting easy cases).

### Cohort

A group of beneficiaries who enter the program during a defined period and are tracked together for outcome measurement.

### Dosage

The intensity and duration of intervention received by each beneficiary. Outcomes may vary based on dosage levels.

### Creaming / Cherry-Picking

The risk that service providers select beneficiaries most likely to succeed regardless of intervention, inflating apparent program effectiveness. Good contract design includes protections against creaming.

### Parking

The opposite of creaming—neglecting harder-to-serve beneficiaries in favor of easier cases. Both creaming and parking distort program effectiveness measurement.

## Notable Examples

### Peterborough SIB (2010)

The first social impact bond, focused on reducing reoffending among short-sentence prisoners released from Peterborough Prison, UK. Achieved its targets and demonstrated proof of concept.

### Educate Girls DIB (2015)

First development impact bond. Funded interventions to improve girls' enrollment and learning outcomes in Rajasthan, India. Exceeded targets; investors received full return plus premium.

### Education Outcomes Fund (EOF)

A major outcomes fund launched to improve education across Africa and the Middle East. Rather than individual deals, it sets rate cards for educational outcomes and pays multiple providers for verified results. Aims to reach 10 million children.

### Massachusetts Juvenile Justice PFS (2014)

US-based SIB focused on reducing recidivism and improving employment outcomes for young people leaving the juvenile justice system. Notable for rigorous RCT evaluation design.

### South Carolina Nurse-Family Partnership (2016)

SIB funding nurse home visits for first-time, low-income mothers. Demonstrates the model applied to early childhood intervention.
