# Stakeholder Ecosystem

This document maps the full ecosystem of actors involved in and affected by Pay-for-Success interventions.

## The Modeling Challenge

Every beneficiary of a social intervention exists within a web of relationships—family, community, employers, institutions. The effects of successful (or unsuccessful) interventions ripple outward through these connections.

**The tension**: We want to capture these secondary effects without expanding the model to include everyone by connection. This document defines concentric rings of stakeholders, from direct deal parties to the broader ecosystem.

## Ring 1: Primary Stakeholders (Deal Parties)

These are the direct participants in the impact bond structure.

### Impact Investors

Provide upfront capital; bear outcome risk.

**Subtypes**:
- Philanthropic investors (foundations, donor-advised funds)
- Commercial impact investors (expecting market-rate returns)
- Blended finance actors (accepting below-market returns for impact)
- Institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies with ESG mandates)

### Government / Outcomes Payer

Commits to paying for achieved outcomes.

**Subtypes**:
- Local government (cities, counties)
- State/regional government
- Federal/national government
- Quasi-governmental entities (development banks, agencies)

### Service Provider / Delivery Organization

Actually delivers the intervention to beneficiaries.

**Key considerations**:
- Often nonprofits with mission alignment
- Must have capacity to scale
- Bear operational risk (investors bear outcome risk)
- May feel caught between funder expectations and beneficiary needs

### Independent Evaluator / Auditor

Measures and verifies outcomes.

**Subtypes**:
- Academic research institutions
- Specialized evaluation firms
- Government accountability offices
- Third-party data analysts

### Beneficiaries (Target Population)

The individuals receiving the intervention.

**Critical insight**: Beneficiaries are not isolated individuals—they exist in relationship networks that are also affected by the intervention.

---

## Ring 2: Affected Communities (Secondary Effects)

These parties don't sit at the negotiating table but are directly affected by the intervention's success or failure.

### Families of Beneficiaries

When a person completes a job training program, their family's economic situation changes. When recidivism is prevented, a family remains intact. **The intervention's effects multiply through family units.**

- Spouses/partners
- Children
- Dependent parents
- Extended family networks

### Employers of Beneficiaries

Employment-focused interventions directly affect the businesses that hire program graduates.

- Hiring decisions
- Workforce quality
- Training investments
- Retention patterns

### Community Organizations & Networks

Local organizations that interact with beneficiaries before, during, and after interventions.

- Religious institutions
- Mutual aid networks
- Neighborhood associations
- Support groups
- Other service providers

### Local Economy

Aggregate effects when interventions operate at scale.

- Consumer spending changes
- Reduced public service demand
- Workforce availability
- Community stability

---

## Ring 3: Broader Ecosystem

These actors shape the environment in which impact bonds operate but are not direct parties to deals.

### Media

#### Trade Media

Specialized outlets covering impact investing, social finance, and philanthropy.

- Stanford Social Innovation Review
- Impact Alpha
- Devex (development sector)
- ESG-focused financial press

**Role**: Shapes narrative within the impact investing community; influences investor appetite and deal flow.

#### Mainstream Media

General news outlets that occasionally cover impact bonds.

**Role**: Shapes public perception; can influence political will for outcomes-based approaches. Coverage tends to be episodic—either "innovative solution" puff pieces or "privatization concern" critiques.

**The disconnect**: Mainstream coverage rarely captures the complexity of stakeholder alignment or the nuances of different deal structures.

### Academia

#### Schools of Government & Public Policy

Researchers studying outcomes-based financing from policy perspectives.

- Evaluating effectiveness vs. traditional procurement
- Analyzing transaction costs
- Studying political economy of PFS adoption
- Developing best practices

**Key institutions**:
- Government Outcomes Lab (Oxford)
- Government Performance Lab (Harvard)
- NYU Wagner (various researchers)
- Various schools of public administration

#### Economics & Finance Departments

Studying the financial and economic dimensions.

- Return profiles and risk analysis
- Market development
- Comparison to other financing mechanisms

#### Social Work & Program Evaluation

Focused on intervention effectiveness and beneficiary outcomes.

- Often skeptical of financialization
- Concerned with equity and selection effects
- Expertise in measuring social outcomes

### Policy Think Tanks

Organizations that advocate for or analyze policy approaches.

- Center for American Progress
- Brookings Institution
- Nesta (UK)
- Various policy institutes

**Role**: Influence policymaker understanding; may advocate for or against PFS approaches.

### Intermediary Organizations

Specialized entities that structure deals and manage relationships (not always present but important).

- Social Finance (UK, US, Israel)
- Third Sector Capital Partners
- Maycomb Capital
- Various regional intermediaries

## Modeling Implications

### What We Model Directly

**Ring 1** (Primary Stakeholders): Full agent representation with deliberation.

### What We Acknowledge

**Ring 2** (Affected Communities): Referenced in agent reasoning—e.g., the Population Agent considers effects on families; the Government Agent weighs community-level impacts.

### What Shapes Context

**Ring 3** (Broader Ecosystem): Influences the environment but not modeled as agents. May inform scenario parameters (e.g., "high media scrutiny" vs. "low visibility" scenarios).

### The Secondary Effect Principle

When agents evaluate a proposal, they should consider:

> "How will success/failure for the direct beneficiary affect their immediate network, and what are the aggregate implications?"

This keeps the model tractable (we're not simulating every family member) while acknowledging that beneficiaries are not islands.

---

## Attracting Interest: The Narrative Challenge

### The Impact Investing Perspective

The impact investing community already has interest but needs:
- Demonstrated success cases
- Clear return profiles
- Reduced transaction friction
- Better deal flow

**Trade media** (Impact Alpha, SSIR) covers this but reaches a self-selected audience.

### The Mainstream Media Challenge

Mainstream coverage is episodic and often misses nuance:
- "Innovative solution" framing (oversimplified)
- "Privatization of social services" framing (oversimplified)
- Rarely captures the stakeholder alignment complexity

**Opportunity**: Human interest stories that follow the ripple effects—the beneficiary, their family, the community change. This is more compelling than financial structure explanations.

### The Academic Contribution

Rigorous research from schools of government provides:
- Evidence base for effectiveness claims
- Framework for evaluating proposals
- Credibility with policymakers

But academic work operates on slow timelines and often doesn't translate to practitioner guidance.

## Summary

| Ring | Actors | Role in Model |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 - Primary | Investors, Government, Service Providers, Evaluators, Beneficiaries | Direct agent representation |
| 2 - Affected | Families, Employers, Communities, Local Economy | Referenced in agent reasoning |
| 3 - Ecosystem | Media, Academia, Think Tanks, Intermediaries | Shapes context/scenarios |

This layered approach lets us model the core negotiation while acknowledging that the effects—and the stakes—extend far beyond the deal parties.
