The functionality of the project proposal drafter is to take proposals for pay-for-success implementations and reformat them into specific policy proposal formats. This ensures that the proposal is well-constructed, well-organized, and addresses all the criteria that a government may wish to see when evaluating a proposal for an impact bond, pay-for-success, or a multilateral agency.
